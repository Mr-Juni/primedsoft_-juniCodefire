## QUADRATIC EQUATION

#### STEP IN SOLVING QUADRATIC EQUATION

* 1). WRITE THE EQUATION IN THE CORRECT FORMAT R FORM.
* 2). FACTOR THE PROBLEM USING FACTOR STARTEGY.
* 3). SET EACH FACTOR CONTAINING A VARIABLE TO ZERO USING ZERO FACTOR PROPERTY.
* 4). SOLVE EACH FACTORS EQUAL TO ZERO TO GET THE X ON ONE SIDE AND THE ANSWER ON THE OTHER SIDE.

WRITE THE EQUATION IN THE CORRECT FORMAT R FORM
* 1-- The equation must be set in it's correct format.
* 2-- To be in its correct format you must remove the parathenses if presents from all side of the equation by distribution.
* 3-- All like terms should be compared, combined and transferd to the left hand side arrannged in decending order.
* 4-- After that the left hand variable and value are then equated to zero.
* 5-- The correct standard format of a quadratic euation is ax2 + bx + c = 0
* 6-- From the eqaution a, b, c is a real number while x is an unknow variable. 

FACTOR THE PROBLEM USING FACTOR STARTEGY
* 1-- The equation can then be solved using the factor strategy
* 2-- Assumming we have and unknow variable which are v and u and we therfore have to find two numbers in respect to u and v.
* 3-- This two numbers add up to b and thier product is c this is sometimes called "Vieta's rule".
* 4-- And example equation is given below x2 + 10x + 16 factors as (x +2)(x - 8).

SET EACH FACTOR CONTAINING A VARIABLE TO ZERO USING ZERO FACTOR PROPERTY
* 1-- Afer factoring we would be left with two factors which is set or equated to zero.
* 2-- This is know as the zero factor property, this is use to get the two real value solution or otherwise called roots.
 
SOLVE EACH FACTORS EQUAL TO ZERO TO GET THE X ON ONE SIDE AND THE ANSWER ON THE OTHER SIDE
* 1-- Now here we determine the real value root from the equation by making the unknown variable eg. (x) as the subject of the formular and then subtrating both side of the eqaution with th real value each to determine the root.
